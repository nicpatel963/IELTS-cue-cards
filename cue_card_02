The fact  is that the water life is so amazing and interesting; however, it is not feasible to explore it fully. 
Among the water animals, I am talking about the one which is  known for its incredible size and weight as it resembles a ship and it is the largest living creature in the world.
Whales usually inhabit in the oceans all around the world and their size varies from 80 to 150 feet.
They usually have a lifespan of an average 77 years, even some of them live over a century.
I have seen this giant mammal on the geography channel during the lockdown period. 
It is said that the weight of its tongue is nearly equivalent to that of an elephant. 
The whales are warm blooded animals and surprisingly, they breathe and  feed milk to their babies as we human do. 
The whale is considered to be an animal that learns, teaches, cooperates and even grieves like other mammals.
I was astonished when I came to know that their breathing hole can expel air with such a great pressure that can sink a ship or damage it heavily. 
I found it so interesting that the omit of sperm whale named ‘ambergris’ is so valuable for the perfume market. 
The Unavoidable truth is that whales have been hunted for the human purpose from the stone age. 
It is sad to say that the whale is declared as an endangered animal to preserve it. 
And last thing that I’d like to add is that whale cannot sleep for long time otherwise they run out of oxygen and can be drown.
