It is a common thing for everyone to carry things in bag of various type such as travel bag, school bag, and carry bag but being student, I usually carry a college bag. 
Nevertheless, I would like to talk about a laptop backpack that I want to buy, and I have seen that in advertisement. 
As the name suggest, this bag is specially designed for carrying laptop with its accessories and it is from a well-known brand known as ‘Dell’. 
I am a student, so I mostly use a backpack to put heavy stuff inside such as books, water bottles, and laptop.

Unfortunately, I do not have any bag that can carry all these things together. 
So, I want to buy a backpack  which might have only two pockets inside and plain texture or have little stones on the front side. 
I am expecting for durable and strong material that can increase the life of the bag. 
Nowadays, all things are easily available on the internet with the affordable price. So, I would like to buy bag through online websites. 

These sites offer a considerable discount such as 50 or 60% to 80% discount on branded bags so this backpack will cost me around 1500 rupees.  
The major reasons for purchasing this backpack is that  it has various benefits like attractive outlook and durable design.
 It has strong outer material which will help me to protect laptop from any damage. Owing to its benefits, the price of the bag worth it. 
So, this is all about the bag I am looking forward to own it.
