It is undoubtedly true that the school days are unavoidable 
part of every ones’ life even it is not an exception for me.
I would like to take this opportunity to talk about my first
day at the school. Let me tell you that my school was just 
few footsteps away from my house and  I vividly remember that
on the very first day, I woke up before the crack of down and
put on fresh uniform and shining shoes. As I was only six years
old, my mother dropped me at the school in early morning. There
I saw that few children unlike me, they were crying and behaving 
like they were forced to join the school but It was not the case 
with me. Infect, I was  very happy to go to the school.  It was 
an amazing experience as I had seen the school for the first time
and I was curious about making new friends. Our day started with 
the group prayer at the assembly hall of the school. Afterwards, 
they took us to the playground where we played numerous games. I 
was feeling astonished and so delighted. After some time, we went
to the classroom and we were introduced to the classmates and teachers.
Meanwhile, the bell rang and teacher announced that it was the end 
of the first day at school. I went back to my mother, she came to 
pick me at the gate of the school and we returned to the home.
So this is how my first day at school passed by enjoying company 
of classmates.
